        Expects `openaiFileIdRefs` containing up to 10 file references from the conversation.
        At runtime, OpenAI populates `openaiFileIdRefs` with objects containing `name`, `mime_type`, and `download_link`.
        This endpoint uploads each file to Notion and returns a `file_upload_id` for each.
        If the service has NOTION_TOKEN set, no request auth is required for this endpoint.
