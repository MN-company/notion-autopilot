Last updated: 2026-02-14

By using Notion Autopilot, you agree to the following:

1. You authorize the app only for workspaces/pages you choose to share.
2. You are responsible for reviewing and approving AI-generated edits before relying on them.
3. The service is provided "as is" without warranties of uninterrupted availability or perfect accuracy.
4. You must not use the service for unlawful activity, abuse, or attempts to access data you are not authorized to access.
5. You may revoke access at any time by disconnecting OAuth access and removing integration permissions in Notion.
6. We may update these terms over time; continued use means you accept the updated terms.
