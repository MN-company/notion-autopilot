# notion-autopilot
I created this repo with the scope tu build a GPT community-oriented. I have built others GPT and decides to keep the backbone private but this one, i think that is better to make it open source so you can use the GPT and improveit at the same time.
I did this choice because I don't use all the thing that Notion offers. I know that there are other possibilities to connect notion to ChatGPT, n8n etc. but this porject is based on my need.

Right now the Autopilot is at version 4 because was developed internally and not public, but from the next update (v5 will arrive soon) i will publish all the code.
