# Privacy Statement
This project provides configuration files for a GPT-style Notion agent. It does not include a hosted backend. When you deploy or run it, the data handling depends on your environment.

## What data is accessed
- The agent accesses Notion content only after you connect a Notion integration and explicitly share pages or databases with it.
- It uses that content solely to fulfill the task you requested.

## What we do not do
- We do not sell or rent user data.
- We do not attempt to access content that has not been shared with the integration.

## Your responsibilities when self-hosting
If you run this yourself, you control retention, logging, and access controls. Review your hosting provider and Notion integration settings to align with your privacy requirements.
