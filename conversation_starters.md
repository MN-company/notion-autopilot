Add a TL;DR / takeaway section with the minimal essential information from [page].
Turn these scattered points into a checklist with to-do items and sub-tasks where it makes sense.
Take this notes page and transform it into a brief with:
context
objective
key points
risks
open questions
I have a page of meeting notes: extract decisions and action items and place them into two sections called “Decisions” and “Actions”.
Insert well-formatted code blocks wherever you find scattered snippets, and add a short explanatory comment above each snippet. [page]
